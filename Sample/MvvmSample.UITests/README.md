# Automated UI Tests

This project contains tests that test the UI. It uses WinAppDriver for automating the app.

There are two styles of of tests:
* Plain tests written in Unit Test framework (currently being skipped)
* Specifications using SpecFlow
  * Features - Expected behavior specified in Gherkin syntax - i.e. structured text.
  * Step Definitions - Implementation of steps from Feature-files in code.

## Setup
